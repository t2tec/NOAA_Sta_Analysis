# NOAA Observation Station Analysis
# Worldwide Density and Diversification

## Summary

The **2016 Weather Data Exploratory Analysis** project was started to review the raw data from **NOAA** and identify areas of uncertainty and their potential impact on reaching a greater than 95% scientific certainty.

This is **Part 2** of the **2016 Weather Data Exploratory Analysis**.

## Goal

This project is designed to analyze **NOAA** worldwide temperature observation stations in terms of:

+ Geographic diversity of stations
+ Geographic density of stations
